# Trends-on-Netflix
An in-depth analysis of Netflix content trends, exploring genre distributions, content type (movies vs. series), release patterns, and ratings. This project uses Python and data visualization to uncover insights
about the Netflix catalog

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project explores Netflix's catalog using a dataset of titles, analyzing content distribution, genre trends, and release patterns. The goal is to provide insights into Netflix's content strategy, examining how
factors like genre popularity, content type, and release year influence the platform’s offerings.


OBJECTIVES:

Analyze Content Types: Compare the distribution between movies and TV series on Netflix.

Explore Genre Trends: Identify the most popular genres and their prevalence over time.

Release Patterns: Examine patterns in the release years, highlighting changes in content volume across years.

Content Ratings: Study the distribution of content ratings to understand the platform's target audience.


TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:

Python: Core language for data processing and analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Plotly/Matplotlib: Visualization libraries to create insights and trends graphs.

Seaborn: For creating visually appealing charts and correlations.


DATASET:

The dataset contains information on Netflix titles, including:

Title: Name of the movie or show.

Type: Whether the content is a "Movie" or "TV Show."

Release Year: The year the title was released.

Genres: Categories associated with each title.

Ratings: Content rating (e.g., PG, TV-MA) indicating target audience.

Country: Region or regions where the title is available.


DATA PREPROCESSING:

Initial steps involve cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing data fields, and standardizing genre information. This preprocessing phase ensures accuracy in the analyses conducted.


EXPLORATARY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA):

Through EDA, the project identifies key trends, such as:

Content Type Distribution: Visualizing the proportion of movies vs. TV shows available on Netflix.

Genre Popularity: Analyzing which genres are most common and how their popularity shifts over time.

Release Year Patterns: Exploring the frequency of title releases across years to uncover content expansion trends.

Rating Distribution: Examining the breakdown of ratings to see the types of audiences Netflix caters to.


KEY INSIGHTS:

Genre and Content Trends: Insights into how Netflix’s genre focus has evolved over time.

Audience Targeting: Observations on Netflix’s content ratings and how they align with audience demographics.

Content Growth: Analysis of the growth in Netflix’s catalog over the years, highlighting increases in movies or TV shows.


CONCLUSION:

This project provides a comprehensive look at Netflix’s catalog, offering valuable insights into content trends, audience targeting, and genre distribution. Such insights can help understand Netflix's content strategy and 
evolution over the years.
